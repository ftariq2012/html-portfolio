    <h3>Bulk PDF Tool</h3>

        <p>
            The creation of this project started when my friend had a usecase for his work where he didn't 
            wanted to do repetitive tasks on hundreds of PDFs. When he reached out to me I saw this as
            an oppurtunity to create a Bulk PDF Editor where you can select directories with multiple PDFs
            and do actions like Merge atatchments, Swap pages, Add Pages, Add Watermarks or Stamps. I used Python
            to code this project and used PyPDF2 library to manipulate pdfs and logging to have cleaner logs
            accomplish this task. With this project I reduced the time to seconds where initially it would have taken
            my friend days to accomplish this task.

            Work-In-Progess: Using a raspberry Pi as the self hosting server. Need to create a web-app 
            that lets me access files on the server regardless of what network I am on. Also want the
            files to be encrypted so the server can be used as a password manager as well.
